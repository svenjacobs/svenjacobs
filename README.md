### Hi there üëãüèª

My name is [Sven](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sven#German) (_he/him_). I'm an [Android](https://android.com) and mobile backend developer from Germany. I also like to dive into Web frontend development with for example [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) from time to time.

I started to write software when I still went to school. I learned and used various programming languages and environments since then. My first computer was an [Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) but I also got in touch with the [C64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) at friends.

<hr/>

I believe that crafting code which is elegant, beautiful, efficient, robust, tested and modular while utilising modern languages, tools, standards and architectural patterns is the foundation of a great application thereby providing the best user experience.

<hr/>

I'm always eager to learn new technologies, programming languages, frameworks, architectural patterns etc. which make the life of a software engineer more pleasant and help in writing better code üôÇ
My favorite topics at the moment are [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) and [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/).

I either work from home which is located in the beautiful [Westerwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerwald) or ‚Äì when in the office ‚Äì in [Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne).
